1. Positives of the group
    All group members were very enthusiastic and met regularly to discuss the project. 
    The work was also well divided and was completed on time.

2. Negatives of the group
    Coding part was left towards the end.
    Unequal contribution

3. What would we do differently next time?
    We would start the coding part a little before hand, so that it becomes easier to make any changes further.
    We would have also liked to develop a web-based app for this software to implement the client-server architectutre.
